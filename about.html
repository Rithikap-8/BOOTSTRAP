Music Concert means an Event featuring amplified musical sound as the primary entertainment feature of the Event. Music Concert does not include incidental musical performances not exceeding one (1) hour in duration, such as half-time shows, school bands, and brief musical entertainment, at Events whose dominant purpose is other than musical entertainment. Music Concerts are subject to several limitations, each of which operates independently of the other. In addition, to the extent a Music Concert also constitutes either a Single Day Special Event or a Multiple Day Special Event, the Music Concert will be subject to the limitations on those types of Events. No more than eight (8) Music Concerts per calendar year will be scheduled. If a Music Concert is a multiple day Event, each day will count as a Music Concert for the purpose of the limitations in the two immediately preceding sentences. Note: if a Music Concert has an actual attendance of 12,500 or more the Music Concert counts as a Single Day Special Event and is included in the ten Event per year Single Day Special Event limitation.) Regardless of attendance, Music Concerts are limited to a total of eight per year.
